# legacy-mods
Over the years, Nosiphus modpack updates have typically come out in rapid succession. Many of these pack updates happened long ago, before CurseForge became a standard hosting location. Because of the significant fracturing of how old mods were hosted, I have been left with a combination of newer mod releases than the publicly uploaded ones that exist on CurseForge, if the official download exists at all. Several mods are completely missing from the Internet these days.

This is an archive of some of those downloads that are particularly difficult, if not downright impossible to track down. The goal is to get these files back to their original authors so they can be officially uploaded to the CurseForge repositories.

As this repository serves our modpack download system as well, particularly for mods that cannot be directly downloaded in any other way.

Examples:
Applied Energistics 2 for 1.17.10's officially released version on Curse is Beta Revision 6, but I have an archive of Beta Revision 11, which was only uploaded to the Applied Energistics website that no longer exists.

Big Reactors' newest release on CurseForge is 0.4.3A, but I have a copy of 0.4.5B, which was only available on the old Big Reactors website.

MrCrayFish's Furniture Mod 3.4 is available on his site, and 3.4.7 is available from Curse, but I have a backup of 3.4.8.

Project Red for 1.6.4 seems to be completely missing as far as I can tell.

Resonant Induction can only be found inside of Technic's mod archive, but the version I have is newer than that one.

I have a newer build of Universal Electricity than Curse does.
